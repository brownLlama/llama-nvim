		-- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
		--
		-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
		--
		-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
		-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
		--
		-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
		-- language (such as gopls, lua_ls, rust_analyzer, etc.). These Language Servers
		-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
		-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
		--
		-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
		--  - Go to definition
		--  - Find references
		--  - Autocompletion
		--  - Symbol Search
		--  - and more!
		--
		-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
		-- Neovim. This is where mason and related plugins come into play.
		--
		-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
		-- and elegantly composed help section, :help lsp-vs-treesitter

		--  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
		--    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
		--    an lsp (for example, opening main.rs is associated with rust_analyzer) this
		--    function will be executed to configure the current buffer

				-- NOTE: Remember that Lua is a real programming language, and as such it is possible
				-- to define small helper and utility functions so you don't have to repeat yourself.
				--
				-- In this case, we create a function that lets us more easily define mappings specific
				-- for LSP related items. It sets the mode, buffer and description for us each time.
				-- The following two autocommands are used to highlight references of the
				-- word under your cursor when your cursor rests there for a little while.
				--    See :help CursorHold for information about when this is executed
				--
				-- When you move your cursor, the highlights will be cleared (the second autocommand).
